### Types of additional data we are looking for:

- Am I going t oanaluze images or the text from images if using instagram?
- What methods will work for both Twitter and Instagram?
- What if people have multiple accounts?
- What do I do with deleted tweets/accounts (longitudinal vs cross sectional study?)
- Individual vs corporate accounts? Celebrities? Sponsored?
- Retweets? Shares? (Probably not relatable to original data)
